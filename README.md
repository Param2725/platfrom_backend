# Video Sharing Platform – Backend

This project is the **backend of a video-sharing platform** built using **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
It serves as the foundation for a platform where users can upload, watch, like, and comment on videos.  
The idea is *inspired by YouTube*, but the architecture, features, and logic are designed from scratch — built entirely from my own perspective of how such a platform should work.
